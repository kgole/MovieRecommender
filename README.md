# MovieRecommender
Content Based Movie Recommender System Web App with py-flask

Algorithm and inspiration: https://medium.com/code-heroku/building-a-movie-recommendation-engine-in-python-using-scikit-learn-c7489d7cb145

Optimization target (so far): 
1. Implementing G Predictive Search in the movie search box
2. Fetching Movie information from TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). 

D'Oh:
1. Algorithm fails if input movie name isn't correctly stylized and title case(d). (suggestions?)
